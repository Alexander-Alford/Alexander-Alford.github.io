      <b>About Me</b>
      <br/><br/>
      <p>
        My name is Alexander and I am a web developer and programmer open to new work, preferably remote. 
        I began developing software as a hobby while I was pursuing my Bachelor's degree at UCSD. 
        What started off as a simple passion project became a fascination for how software is made and shared.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then, I have grown into web development where I get to work with some of the most cutting-edge
        technology  available. I see programming as a way to explore a language's potential, to solve problems 
        simple and complex, and to harness  the power of a computer. Thank you for stopping by, and if you're 
        interested, feel free to reach out and contact me below.

            This web app uses MongoDB Atlas to store and provide its product data. 
            By using an access key to the data cluster, the server can access the document 
            collection for the prop products and perform read operations on them.
            The data is loaded server-side with the help of Mongoose to simplify MongoDB driver details.
            Once the data is loaded, it is sent to an api endpoint that the client-side application 
            pulls from. Server routing and the RESTful api is controlledusing Express functionality. 
            The client can post a request to the server to load filtered response data from the 
            database based on given criteria.

          <p>
            This mock website is an imaginary online retailer that sells animals and animal 
            products. The purpose of this project was to experiment, develop, and deploy a web 
            app that uses React and MongoDB to create a client-server model that allows the user
            to interact with a cloud database in ways that mimic popular online retailers like 
            Amazon. Data for the website was generated and is accessed with MongoDB Atlas while 
            content is rendered with individual react components that respond to state changes. 
            I used Heroku to deploy the app as a live demo that anybody can try.
          </p>
          <br/> 
          <p>
            The demo provides a functional product page allowing the user to inspect items, add 
            them to their carts, go to checkout, modify their order, and then send it out.
            In addition, the user can query for specific kinds of items and adjust how many items 
            are displayed. A nonfunctional sign in and register page are provided to complete the 
            environment.

          The client side of this web app is rendered dynamically with React.The website is 
          composed of nested react components that use a mixture of hooks, props, and pure 
          javascript for interactivity. Data from the api endpoint is loaded for the home 
          page by use of a state variable whose hook sets the state and re-renders every time 
          it's called. JSX allows for easy incorporation of javascript functionality into html 
          giving an interactive user interface for the user's cart that allows items to be added
          and removed while the page is visibly updated. Bootstrap 5 is used to style the website 
          along with custom edits. The Bootstrap classes provide styling that adjusts with screen 
          dimensions for platform independent websites.

            This project was one of my first major software development projects. The goal of 
            the project was to improve my general programming skill and gain a better understanding 
            of the C language.

            <br>
            <p>
              One of the first parts of the engine developed was the collision detection and 
              resolution system. This system allowed moving objects to collied with terrain 
              and be ejected reliably and efficiently. Over time the system algorithms was 
              revised several times to more accurately resolve collisions and to detect 
              non-rectangular collisions.

          <h1>Tiling and Graphics</h1>
          <br>
          <p>
            Alongside the collision detection and resolution, a grid-based tiling system was 
            developed to create the platforms in the game engine. These tiles were drawn with 
            hardware accelerated rendering of select portions of source images. Grid based tiling 
            allows for platforms that are highly optimized in memory and performance.

          <h1>Object System</h1>
          <br>
          <p>
            The object system allows for the creation of objects that can interact with platforms 
            and other objects according to AI or user input. Objects can store data that is unique 
            to each individual member as well as data that is shared among all of the instances of a 
            kind of object.

          <h1>Sounds and Timing</h1>
          <br>
          <p>
            One of the later elements added was a sound system that can play queued sounds in addition 
            to background music. Each queued sound is given a specific channel that it can play on so 
            that sounds can overlap. A timing system was also added to control framerate as well as the 
            speed at which the game played.

        <h3>Atom Physics Simulator</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          This program is an atomic physics simulator designed to simulate sub-atomic particles and the 
          forces that they interact with by using VPython's API. The VPython module provides a simple 
          implementation of 3D graphics, vector math, and graphing capabilities that can easily be 
          implemented. GlowScript is a javascript api based off of VPython that, with the help of the 
          RapydScript transpiler, allows the Python script to run in the browser.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          This simulation can be paused and reset to its initial state at any time. Scrolling can be 
          used to zoom in and out on the canvas, while holding shift and dragging with your mouse can 
          pan it. While running, the average electron orbital radius is graphed in real time and the 
          electrostatic force can be changed at any time by the user to alter the orbit.

          First, the user provides their current 401k, IRA, and taxable portfolios in terms of 
          the amount of money invested in bonds, stocks, and international stocks respectively.
          They then provide their desired asset allocation, their monthly investment amount, and 
          details about their 401k and their IRA. Finally, the user can calculate their most tax 
          efficient year long investment strategy.

          Once the investment strategy is calculated the user can then view their recommended 
          investments into each portfolio for each month of the year. Their investments are 
          divided based on their desired split between bonds and stocks with slight changes to 
          maximize tax reduction. A graph is given to show the total investments across all

        <p>
          National University is my current job and my first professional role as a web 
          developer. As a web developer and designer, I'm tasked with managing mostly 
          frontend content as well as working with other team members to properly connect 
          the backend. I work in a small team of about 8 other developers whom I coordinate 
          with on how the workload will be divided. The majority of my work involves patching 
          issues in National University sites including restyling pages, ensuring that they 
          are screen reader and keyboard compatible, and fixing compatability bugs. On 
          occasion, I am given larger projects that I will work on with another web developer
          who can help with backend work and other server/security issues that I can't directly 
          work on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since I've began, I've updated several websites, fixed dozens of bugs, and have helped 
          complete a few of the University's larger projects. I've learned so much about designing 
          for web accessibility, debugging obscure device specific bugs, and refactoring older
          code to help clean it up and keep it up to date. My team has been both incredibly supportive 
          when I need help and unrestrained in giving me good challenges that have improved my 
          knowledge and allowed me to significantly contribute to accomplishing goals. I believe 
          this was the perfect entry level role for me to learn and grow as a developer.
