    <b style="font-size:30px">About Me</b><br>
    <p>My name is Alexander and I am a junior web developer currently looking for web development work. 
      I began developing software as a hobby while I was pursuing my Bachelor's degree. 
      What started off as a simple passion project in C became a fascination for how software is made and shared.</p>
    <p>Since then, I have grown into web development where I get to work with some of the most cutting-edge technology available.
      I see programming as a way to explore a language's potential to solve problems simple and complex. 
      Thanks for stopping by, if you're interested, feel free to reach out and contact me below:</p><br>

        <h1>A 2D Game Engine</h1>
        <p>This project was one of my first major software development projects. 
          The goal of the project was to improve my general programming skill and gain a better understanding of the C language.</p>

        <h1>Collision Detection and Resolution</h1>
        <br>
        <p>One of the first parts of the engine developed was the collision detection and resolution system.
          This system allowed moving objects to collied with terrain and be ejected reliably and efficiently.
          Over time the system was revised several times to more accurately resolve collisions and to detect non-rectangular collisions.

        <h1>Tiling and Graphics</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Alongside the collision detection and resolution, a grid-based tiling system was developed to create the platforms in the game engine.
           These tiles were drawn with hardware accelerated rendering of select sections of source images.
           Grid based tiling allows for platforms that are highly optimized in memory and performance.

        <h1>Object System</h1>
        <br>
        <p>The object system allows for the creation of objects that can interact with platforms and other objects according to AI or user input. 
          Objects can store data that is unique to each individual member as well as data that is shared among all of the instances of a kind of object.

        <h1>Sounds and Timing</h1>
        <br>
        <p>One of the later elements added was a sound system that can play queued sounds in addition to background music. 
          Each queued sound is given a specific channel that it can play on so that sounds can overlap.
          A timing system was also added to control framerate as well as the speed at which the game played.

    This program is an atomic physics simulator designed to simulate a number of sub-atomic particles and the forces that they interact with by using VPython's API.
    The VPython module provides a simple implementation of 3D graphics, vector math, and graphing capabilities that can easily be implemented. 
    The simulation can be paused at any time. 
    While running, the average electron radius is graphed in real time and the electrostatic force can be disabled at any time by the user.

	<div class="ford-container" id="ford-mongo">
    <img src="images/MongoDB_logo.png" class="ford-image" />
	This web app uses MongoDB Atlas to store its product data. 
	The data is loaded server-side with the help of Mongoose to simplify MongoDB driver details.
	Once the data is loaded, it is sent to an api endpoint that the client-side application pulls from.
	The client can also post a request to the server to load filtered data from the database based on given criteria.

	<div class="ford-container" id="ford-react">
    <img src="images/React_logo.png" class="ford-image" />
	The client-side part of this web app is rendered dynamically with React.
	The website is composed of nested react components that use a mixture of hooks and plain javascript for interactivity.
	Data from the api endpoint is loaded for the home page by use of a state variable whose hook sets the state every time it's called. 
	JSX allows for easy incorporation of javascript functionality into html giving a dynamic user interface.
